Exp 2. Experimental determination of currents and voltages in circuits using Mesh analysis

Aim:-

To determine the current in circuit using mesh analysis both theoretically and practically for a given DC circuit

APPARATUS REQUIRED:

SL.NO APPARATUS SPECIFICATION QUANTITY

1. Regulated Power supply ( RPS) (0-30 V) 1

PROCEDURE:

1. Give connections as per the circuit diagram.
2. Switch ON the supply, vary the RPS (Regulated Power Supply) and set a particular input voltage.
3. Note down the readings of ammeters and voltmeters and tabulate them.
4. Vary the RPS for different input voltages and note down the readings of all the meters.
5. Reduce the RPS to its minimum value and switch OFF the supply.
6. Using the tabulated values, verify Kirchoff’s laws practically, and verify it theoretically.





Practical:-

I1 = 2.2105A & I2 = 2.3509A

RESULT:

Thus, the Mesh analysis is verified practically and theoretically. The resultant currents for / V supply are:

a) The current across resistor R1 is 2.508A.

b) The current across resistor R2 is 2.3006A. 

c) The current across resistor R3 is 0.511A.
